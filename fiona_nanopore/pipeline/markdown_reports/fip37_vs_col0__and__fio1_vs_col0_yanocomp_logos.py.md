# Sequence motif and distribution analysis for sites found in comparison *fip37-4* vs. Col-0 and also in comparison *fio1-3* vs. Col-0



There were 2473 sites identified in the comparison *fip37-4* vs. Col-0 and also in comparison *fio1-3* vs. Col-0. We flattened any overlapping sites and performed motif analysis. The motif shown below was detected at 1201 sites.
