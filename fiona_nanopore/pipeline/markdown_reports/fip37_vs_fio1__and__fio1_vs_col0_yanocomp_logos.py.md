# Sequence motif and distribution analysis for sites found in comparison *fip37-4* vs. *fio1-3* and also in comparison *fio1-3* vs. Col-0



There were 2775 sites identified in the comparison *fip37-4* vs. *fio1-3* and also in comparison *fio1-3* vs. Col-0. We flattened any overlapping sites and performed motif analysis. The motif shown below was detected at 847 sites.
