# Sequence motif and distribution analysis for sites found in comparison *fip37-4* vs. Col-0 which are not found in *fio1-3* vs. Col-0



There were 18248 sites identified in the comparison *fip37-4* vs. Col-0 which are not found in *fio1-3* vs. Col-0. We flattened any overlapping sites and performed motif analysis. The motif shown below was detected at 5429 sites.
