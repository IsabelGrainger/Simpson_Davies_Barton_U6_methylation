## Pipelines and notebooks for U6 snRNA m6A paper

Bel - practice forking from a public repo

This repo contains all the scripts, snakemake pipelines, and jupyter notebooks used to create the figures for the paper "m6A modification of U6 snRNA modulates usage of two major classes of pre-mRNA 5â€™ splice site".

The analysis is separated into three pipelines:

* **fiona_nanopore**: scripts, pipelines and notebooks to generate figure 3 (nanopore DRS analysis of fio1-1 mutant).
* **fiona_temp_rnaseq**: scripts, pipelines and notebooks to generate figures 4-7 (Illumina RNA-Seq analysis of fio1-3 mutant).
* **global_5ss_analysis**: scripts, pipelines and notebooks to generate figure 8 (Global analysis of 5'SSs in Arabidopsis, human, C. elegans, Drosophila, and zebrafish).
