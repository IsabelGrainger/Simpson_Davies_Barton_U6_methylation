# Initial splicing analysis using reference transcriptome assembly



Consistent with previous studies, we found that intron retention is the predominant class of alternative splicing event detected when Arabidopsis plants are subjected to different temperatures – 48.3% (1110) of the splicing events with alternative usage at different temperatures were retained introns.

In contrast, when we repeated this analysis to classify alternative splicing events that differ between *fio1-3* and Col-0 backgrounds, we found that a much larger proportion of alternative splicing events were classified as alternative 5’SS usage – 28.2% (565) of FIO1–dependent splicing events were alternative 5’SSs, compared to only 16.9% (388) of temperature-dependent events. In addition, we detected changes in the PSI of retained introns, exon skipping and alternative 3’SS selection.

There was a significant overlap between splicing events sensitive to loss of FIO1, and those that were sensitive to temperature (hypergeometric-test p = 2e-92). However, in 75.8% of fio1-sensitive events, loss of FIO1 did not alter splicing responses to temperature. Of the remaining 497 splicing events which did have altered temperature sensitivity in the absence of FIO1, 28.8% (143) were alternative 5’SSs, and of these alternative 5’SSs, 59.4% had greater sensitivity to loss of FIO1 at 28oC than at 4oC. This suggests that FIO1 buffers accurate 5’SS selection at elevated temperature.
