Consistent with previous studies, we found that intron retention is the predominant class of alternative splicing event detected when Arabidopsis plants are subjected to different temperatures – {temp_perc_ri:.1f}% ({temp_num_ri:d}) of the splicing events with alternative usage at different temperatures were retained introns.
In contrast, when we repeated this analysis to classify alternative splicing events that differ between *fio1-3* and Col-0 backgrounds, we found that a much larger proportion of alternative splicing events were classified as alternative 5’SS usage – {geno_perc_a5:.1f}% ({geno_num_a5:d}) of FIO1–dependent splicing events were alternative 5’SSs, compared to only {temp_perc_a5:.1f}% ({temp_num_a5:d}) of temperature-dependent events. In addition, we detected changes in the PSI of retained introns, exon skipping and alternative 3’SS selection.
There was a significant overlap between splicing events sensitive to loss of FIO1, and those that were sensitive to temperature (hypergeometric-test p = {geno_temp_hypg_p:.1g}). However, in {geno_perc_not_gxt:.1f}% of fio1-sensitive events, loss of FIO1 did not alter splicing responses to temperature. Of the remaining {geno_num_gxt:d} splicing events which did have altered temperature sensitivity in the absence of FIO1, {gxt_perc_a5:.1f}% ({gxt_num_a5:d}) were alternative 5’SSs, and of these alternative 5’SSs, {a5_gxt_perc_hightemp_extreme:.1f}% had greater sensitivity to loss of FIO1 at 28oC than at 4oC. This suggests that FIO1 buffers accurate 5’SS selection at elevated temperature.
