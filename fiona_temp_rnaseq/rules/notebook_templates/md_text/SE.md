A common form of alternative splicing involves the excision of an exon and flanking introns in a splicing event called exon skipping. We identified {num_se:d} exons with significantly different levels of skipping in *fio1-3*. Of these, {perc_inc:.1f}% have increased levels of inclusion, and {perc_skip:.1f}% have increased levels of skipping. We considered these two groups separately and performed 5’SS motif analysis.
We found that in cases where exon skipping increased in *fio1-3*, {se_perc_a4:.1f}% of the 5’SS at the downstream intron (i.e. at the 3’ end of the skipped exon) had A+4, in conjugation with weak U5 snRNA loop 1 interacting sequences. In comparison, the 5’SS of the upstream intron was more likely to have a stronger U5 snRNA loop 1 interacting sequence. This is consistent with a relative weakening of the recognition of the 5’SS at the downstream intron in fio1-3. 
In cases where exon inclusion increased in *fio1-3*, we found that {ie_perc_u4:.1f}% of 5’SSs at the 3’ end of the skipped exon had U+4, compared to only {ie_perc_a4:.1f}% with A+4. In comparison, {uie_perc_a4:.1f}% of 5’SSs upstream of the skipped exon had A+4, indicating that the relative strength of the two 5’SSs changes in *fio1-3*.
